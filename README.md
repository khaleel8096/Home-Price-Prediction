# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost. The dataset used contains information about houses in King County, USA.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Dataset
The dataset (`kc_house_data.csv`) provides details about houses and is included in the project repository.

## Models Trained
### 1. Linear Regression
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 197,880.24
- R-squared score: 0.7320

### 2. Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 108,536.24
- R-squared score: 0.9194

### 3. XGBoost
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 108,536.24
- R-squared score: 0.9194

## Results and Interpretation
- XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Regressor demonstrate similar and superior performance compared to Linear Regression.
- The models are evaluated based on RMSE and R-squared score.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.
